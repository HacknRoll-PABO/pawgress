## About
Pawgress was inspired by our love for animals and a desire to boost productivity. The idea of combining a virtual pet with task management struck us as a unique way to empower users to stay productuve. This tool aims to help users efficiently manage their tasks whilst enjoying the companionship of a delightful virtual pet.

## How Did We Build It?
For the Frontend, we developed a Single Page Application (SPA) leveraging React for its efficient component-based architecture and state management capabilities. Tailwind CSS was integrated as the utility-first CSS framework to streamline the styling process and ensure a responsive design. The application was built and optimized using Vite, which significantly enhanced the development experience with its fast bundling and hot module replacement features.

On the Backend, the backend infrastructure was supported by an SQLite database, chosen for its simplicity and ease of setup during development. The application featured CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, to manage tasks and user interactions efficiently.

We interfaced both the Frontend and Backend through API calls.

## Closing Thoughts
Pawgress is more than just a productivity tool, it is a delightful companion that makes managing tasks enjoyable. By integrating task management with a virtual pet, users can stay motivated and productive whilst having fun. This project taught us valuable lessons in user experience, gamification, and iterative development, all of which contributed to the development of Pawgress.
